# mlspl-extensibility-examples

This repository holds examples of custom algorithms that can be used with the [Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/) (MLTK).

Many of the examples can also be found in the [ML-SPL API Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/latest/API/Introduction).

This app does require that you alreay have the MLTK & Python for Scientific Computing add-on already installed.
